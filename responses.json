Please confirm when you receive it.\n\nKindly provide us with the guard\u2019s name and number prior to the post.\n \n\n<b><em>Important Update: New Clock In/Out Procedure</b>\nWe are rolling out a new clock in/out procedure. From now on, please have the guard scan the QR code on the last page of the work order and follow the on-screen prompts. Please note that due to this client's wishes, when the guard is using our QR code to clock in and it asks them to take a picture, the guards can only take pictures OUTSIDE the location (main entrance or store sign) and NOT to take any pictures inside store, with store staff or with store merchandise. They will still be required to enter a PIN. \n\nThe PIN for this post is <b>{{PIN}}</b>.\n\nIf the QR code does not work, the guard can still (temporarily) use the old method to login in, but we are attempting to only use the QR code going forward, so please let us know if the guard is having an issue with the QR code at this post, especially if it is a geo-tagging issue where it says they are not on location but they are. \n\nOld Method - Guard can call (929) 229-7799 to electronically sign in/out. Follow the phone prompts: press 1 to check in, 2 to check out.\n\nOR they can call into 888-782-3900 and our dispatch team can check them in manually. </em>\n\n \nPlease make sure you are sending the invoice for this shift within 1 week of date of coverage to Invoices@GuardServicesUSA.com and Service@GuardServicesUSA.com to prevent any billing delays.",
